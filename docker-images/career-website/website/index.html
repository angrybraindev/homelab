                    <p class="lead mb-5">Over the course of my career in the technology industry, I have had the privilege of learning, developing, and applying my skills across a wide range of applications in several industries. Whether it's planning and executing new development projects, serving as an SME in sales, or working in the field deploying equipment for clean power systems, I am always seeking opportunities to learn and expand my skill set.                  
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">In recent years, I have expanded my role to include project management and team leadership. I currently lead a multidisciplinary team of engineers, developers, and technologists, guiding them to execute projects and drive product innovation through research and development. In addition to physical product development, our team has designed and deployed multiple web applications hosted in cloud environments, built using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools and principles. With my technical background in infrastructure, security, and networking, I am responsible for maintaining the cloud development environments in which our services are deployed, prioritizing workloads for our development team, and forecasting the roadmaps for the products and services we are working on.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">When I think about the most rewarding moments in my career, they have been centered around nurturing growth within my team, seeing the people I lead excel in their roles, and witnessing our collective ideas come to life.</p>

                    <p>Outside of work, I love to experience and explore the outdoors. I am somewhat mechanically inclined so I build and maintain an offroad recreational vehicle I use to explore British Columbia's backcountry. In addition, I maintain a membership to the Four Wheel Drive Association of British Columbia, a non-profit organization that advocates to keep public access to public land, where we promote and educate recreational users on the responsible use of public and private lands.</p>

                    <p>I also enjoy hiking and fishing when the seasons are favourable and am privileged to live in a place that has so much to offer locally. One of my favorite pastimes is to explore the wilderness with my partner to find waterfalls and cool places to relax and have a fire.</p>

                    <p>When the weather is rainy, as it often is in the lower mainland, I pass the time gaming and building PCs. I enjoy helping my friends, family, and kids get into the custom PC space and help them build up skills, knowledge, and confidence in choosing parts and building their own computers. I quite often give away my older computer parts to help kids afford their first PC.</p>
